**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned how to use them to position things on a web page. I also learned that padding will appear to extend a div.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I now have a better understanding of the position property.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

I found it pretty easy to add the background in the header and footer because I already did that in a different challenge. The most difficult part was getting certain elements to center vertically.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned how to make elements appear on a header or footer. You have to set the display to inline-block so they don't appear on top of each other.
