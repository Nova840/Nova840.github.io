		    <h4 class="postDate">3/3/16</h4>
			<p>An array in Ruby is a list of variables. It is useful when you have a large or unknown amount of objects to store. An array is defined like this:</p>
			<pre>
array = []

#is the same as

array = Array.new
			</pre>
			<p>If you want add an item to the array you would do it like this:</p>
			<pre>
array.push(item)
			</pre>
			<p>This will add the item at the end of the array.</p>
			<p>You would retrieve that item by giving the array the index (the numerical position that the item is located at, with the first item being 0) like this:</p>
			<pre>
array[index]
			</pre>
			<p>And to remove an item, you would do:</p>
			<pre>
array.delete_at(index)
			</pre>
			<p>A hash is similar to a list but instead of using an index, you use user-defined keys. You define a hash like this:</p>
			<pre>
hash = {}

#is the same as

hash = Hash.new
			</pre>
			<p>To add an item to a hash, you need to specify a key in addition to the item you are storing.</p>
			<pre>
hash[:key] = value
# if the key already exists, it will change the key's value.
			</pre>
			<p>To retrieve a value, you would use the key, similar to how you would use an index in an array.</p>
			<pre>
hash[:key]
			</pre>
			<p>To remove an item from a hash, it would look like this:</p>
			<pre>
hash.delete(:key)
			</pre>
			<p>You would use an array when you are grouping similar objects and need to keep them all in one place, like a list of students in a class. A hash is appropriate for when you need to retrieve specific values in a list. For example, in a dictionary the key would be a word and the value would be its definition.
