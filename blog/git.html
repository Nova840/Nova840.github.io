        Version control is when you store what changes are made to files in an organized way. The main benefits of version control are the ability to see what changes were made and go back to them if needed.

      <p>
        Git is software that lets you do this. When you "commit" a file using git, it creates a "save point" where you currently are, and you can go back to that save later. This is helpful if you make a mistake or accidentally delete something.
      </p>

        GitHub is a service that stores these save points in the cloud. The advantage of using GitHub is that you can share files with other people while using different computers.
