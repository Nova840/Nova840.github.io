Reflection:

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was nice to be able to get ideas from a partner instead of just working off of your own ideas.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	I found it helpful when I was developing because it gave me something to work off of.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

	We decided a good wireframe was a simple one that gave you an idea of where to start.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I learned how to use the <button> tag.
