			<p>
				A class in Ruby is like a blueprint that can be used to create objects. Objects created from a class will inherit all of the behaviors of the blueprint.
			</p>
			<p>
				You define a class like this:
			</p>
			<pre>
class ExampleClass

end
			</pre>
			<p>
				Classes can have methods that represent certain behaviors. A method in a class would look like this:
			</p>
			<pre>
class ExampleClass

	def example_method
		#Do something.
	end

end
			</pre>
			<p>
				Another important part of classes is the ability to store data. Data can vary between different objects created by the class. This is how you would store data that belongs on the object.
			</p>
			<pre>
class ExampleClass

	attr_accessor :exampleData

end
			</pre>
			<p>
				Now we will access that data outside of the class.
			</p>
			<pre>
# Create an object from the class.
exampleInatance = ExampleClass.new

# Store exampleData into a variable called data.
data = exampleInstance.exampleData
			</pre>
			<p>
				You can use classes to model real-world things. If you modeled a person, it could look something like this:
			</p>
			<pre>
class Person

attr_accessor :name
attr_accessor :age

	def talk
		puts "My name is #{@name} and I am #{@age} years old."
	end

end
			</pre>
			<p>
				Using this, you could access the person's name and age as well as make them say something. The only problem is we never actually gave the person a name or age.
			</p>
			<pre>
# Create new person
person_1 = Person.new

# Give the person a name
person_1.name = "Bob"

# Give the person an age
person_1.age = 100

# Make the person say their name and age
person_1.talk
			</pre>
