		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.18.0:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">8/22/16</p>
		<p>I spent a lot of time in GIMP over the last few days. I'm working on making the UI less text-based.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gave the tutorial images to be more readable.</li>
			<li>Made a player registration UI thingy (technical term).</li>
			<li>Bug fixes.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.17.0: Tutorial</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">8/15/16</p>
		<p>I added a tutorial level and a bunch of new events, which can now happen randomly in versus mode. Next week I plan on improving the UI with super fancy images and stuff.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Events can happen in versus mode.</li>
			<li>New events: fire rain, fog, increased gravity, no gravity, increased game speed, and decreased game speed.</li>
			<li>Added a tutorial level.</li>
			<li>Bug fixes.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.16.0:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">8/8/16</p>
		<p>There's not much in terms of playable content this week. I fixed the menu navigation to work with all input methods and added the ability to pause the game.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Menu navigation now works across multiple input types.</li>
			<li>The ability to pause the game.</li>
			<li>Bug fixes.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.15.1:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">8/2/16</p>
		<p>I fixed the bug with the trigger buttons on a controller. The features described for 0.15.0 now actually work.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.15.0:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">8/1/16</p>
		<p>It's now possible to get un-stuck when you flip upside down. There's also a "slow aim" button which lowers the sensetivity of the aim axes. I found this to be very helpful when using a controller.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rotate tank button (left shift/LT while moving)</li>
			<li>Slow aim button (RT and right ctrl, but not very useful on a keyboard)</li>
			<li>Made enemies spawn in a weird bubble thing.</li>
			<li>A lot of minor bug fixes and stuff.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.14.1: Quick Big Fix</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">7/25/16</p>
		<p>There was a bug where enemies wouldn't shoot at you from far away. I squashed it.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.14.0:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">7/25/16</p>
		<p>This is mostly an under the hood update. I've built a standard level controller so I can create content quickly in the future.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>New test level.</li>
			<li>Fixed a lot of bugs.</li>
			<li>Added the ability for "events" to occur. The first of these is bullet rain.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.13.0:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">7/17/16</p>
		<p>Well, my computer's still broken, but I was able to work on it from my laptop for a little while. Nevermind about the regular sized update for this week.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adjusted enemy health and shot damage.</li>
			<li>3 new shot types, vertical splitter, fire, and square.</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">No Update This Week</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">7/10/16</p>
		<p>Due to my computer randomly exploding, I was not able to work on the game this week. I've ordered the replacement part and it should get here around Wednesday. I'm still planning on a regular sized update for Monday, but that might not be possible depending on how much time I get to work on it.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.12.0: Game Modes</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">7/4/16</p>
		<p>I feel like this is the update where it's starting to resemble the finished product I have in mind. Just... uglier.</p>
		<p>There are two game modes now, co-op and competitive, both with one basic level. Bigger, better, less designed-in-thirty-seconds-y levels are on the way.</p>
		<p>Since I'm finished with the basics, I now plan on making the game more fun to play as well as adding more content.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Healthbars on other tanks.</li>
			<li>A sample co-op level for up to 4 players.</li>
			<li>Fixed a lot of bugs.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.11.0: Better Multiplayer</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">6/26/16</p>
		<p>I un-bugified the multiplayer, but in doing so I broke everything else. For now all of the levels are disabled, but I will soon be making more that are co-op multiplayer compatible.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.10.0: Multiplayer</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">6/19/16</p>
		<p>This week I found out that networked multiplayer is impossible in a web browser. So for now, the game will be local multiplayer only. I still have to update a lot of existing systems, so it's pretty buggy as of right now.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Controller support.</li>
			<li>A bug-filled local multiplayer PVP arena.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="column">

		<p class="announcementDate">5/15/16</p>

	<div class="column">
		<h1 class="announcementTitle">Version 0.4.1:</h2>
		<p class="announcementDate">5/8/16</p>
		<p>I've been pretty busy this week, and getting the AI to shoot at you is harder than it sounds. So for now they just awkwardly stare at you.</p>
		<p>Also, you can now enjoy a weird pulsating pink box. Just don't touch it.</p>
		<p>Features:</p>
