<p><b>Step 1: Right click the image below and save it to your computer. This is the default skin.<b></p>

<img src="Default Skin.png" width="300em"></img>

<p><b>Step 2: Edit the image using a program on your computer. Example:<b></p>

<img src="Modified Skin.png" width="300em"></img>

<p><b>Step 3: Go to Google Sites and create a new site.<b></p>

<img src="Sites1-arrow.png" width="600em"></img>

<p><b>Step 4: Click publish.<b></p>

<img src="Sites2-arrow.png" width="600em"></img>

<p><b>Step 5: Give it a URL (it will never be seen by other players, so it doesn't really matter), then click publish.<b></p>

<img src="Sites3-arrow.png" width="600em"></img>

<p><b>Step 5: Click the arrow next to publish, then view published site.<b></p>

<img src="Sites4-arrow.png" width="600em"></img>

<p><b>Step 6: Right click the skin image, then click copy image address. You should be able to paste that into where it says "Skin Image URL" in-game.<b></p>

<img src="Sites4-arrow.png" width="600em"></img>

<p><b>To get back to this site, just sign back into Google Sites with the same account and you should be able to find it. Or you know, bookmark it or something.<b></p>

<p><b>You can also use any image off of the Internet by doing the same right click/copy image address as in step 6, but it might get distorted since it expects a 2:1 image.<b></p>
